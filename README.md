# AirBnb Listing Analysis

AirBnb data for ~250,000+ listings across 10 major cities along with ~5 million guest reviews. The file consists of  5, 642, 855 records with 36 fields.
This project is done using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Excel.
There are 3 Objectives to be focused;
First objective is to read in the AirBnB listings data, calculate basic profiling metrics, change column datatypes as necessary, and filter down to only Paris Listings.
Second objective is to produce DataFrames that will be used in visualizations by aggregating and manipulating the listings data in several ways.
Final objective is to build visuals to show the number of new hosts by year, overall average price by year and neighborhood, and average price for various types of listings in Paris' most expensive neighborhood.
